# Synonyms Extractor

The application extract synonyms and semantic relationships between words using lexical graph. The graph is generated from a text corpus by embedding syntactically parsed sentences in the graph structure. The corpus was generated by web (keywords) search. The vertices of the graph are lexical items (words). The structure of the graph and distances between vertices can be utilized to define metrics for identification of semantic relations between words. The approach has been evaluated on Arabic dialect words.
